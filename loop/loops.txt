What is a Loop?
1. Code that runs multiple times based on a condition.
2. Loops also after the flow of execution, similar to functions.
    . functions: Reusable blocks of code.
    . Loops: Repeated execution of code.
3. Loops automate repetitive.
4. Types of Loops: for, while, do-while.
5. Iterations: Number of times the loop runs.


* While Loop:
while (condition){
    // block of code
}

// Accumulator Pattern
1. A pattern to accumulate values through looping.
2. common scenarios:
    . Sum all the numbers in an array
    . create a modified copy od an array.


//Break & Continue
1.Break lets you stop a loop early, or break out loop.
2. Continue is used to skip one Iteration or the current Iteration.
3. In while loop remember to do the increment manually before using Continue.
